# Household-Expenditure-Analysis-and-Demographic-Insights

The case study aims to help you understand household spending patterns and how they connect to income and demographic factors such as family size and education. As you work through it, you’ll develop essential data analysis skills and gain valuable insights into consumer behavior.

Dataset Information
This dataset contains information expenditure in different categories, demographic characteristics, and other relevant variables. The goal of this analysis is to help you, the data analyst, understand household spending behavior and its potential relationship with demographic factors like income, household composition, and the head's education level.

KPI's:

Task 1:

A.	Draw a unique random sample of two hundred and fifty (250) households following the instruction sheet available with the unprocessed data set.

B.  Compute the descriptive statistics for the following four expenditure variables.
a)	Grocery
b)	Fuel
c)	Phone
d)	Utilities

C. Use information from the descriptive statistics in part (B) above to present a summary of your findings by contrasting different features of the distributions of the four variables.

D. Draw a scatter plot of the natural log of total expenditures against the natural log of post-tax income, that is, ln(Texp) against ln(ATaxInc). Compute the coefficient of correlation between them. What relationship does the plot and correlation coefficient imply between the two variables?




Task 2:

A) Find the Proportion of Households with At Least One Child.

B) Find the Proportion of Households with Exactly One Adult.

C) What is the proportion of the households where there are only one adult and at least one child?

D)  Among the households consisting of only one adult and at least one child (the ones you looked at in part C above), find the proportion of male-headed households. Is a single father household more common than a single mother household?

E)  Among the households consisting of only one adult and at least one child (the ones you looked at in part C above), find the proportion of households that do not own a house. Do the majority of single-parent households own a house?




Task 3: Household head's education

A.	Construct a contingency table between the gender and the highest educational degree of the household head.

B.  What is the probability that a randomly chosen head of a household is female and her highest degree is Bachelors?

C. Among the households whose heads have a Bachelor’s degree, what is the probability that the household head is female?

D. Among the households whose heads are male, what is the probability that the household head has a Master’s degree as the highest educational degree?

E.  Do you think that the two events "the gender of the household head is female" and "the highest educational degree of the household head is primary school certificate" are independent of each other? Justify your answer briefly.
